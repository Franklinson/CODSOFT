# Todo List App and Contact Book
## Todo List App
This is a project done with my internship with CodSoft. 
A To-Do List application is a useful project that helps users manage
and organize their tasks efficiently. This project aims to create a
command-line or GUI-based application using Python, allowing users to create, update, and track their to-do lists.

# Here are the components:
* Task List View: Displays the list of todo items.
* Task Input Field: Allows users to enter new tasks.
* Add Task Button: Submits the new task to the list.
* Edit Task Feature: Enables users to modify existing tasks.
* Delete Task Button: Removes tasks from the list.
* Task Filters: Allows users to filter tasks by status (e.g., all, active, completed).
* Task Completion Toggle: Lets users mark tasks as completed or incomplete.
* Task Details View: Displays additional details about a task (optional).

# User Account Components:

* User Registration and Login: Allows users to create accounts and log in.
* Profile Management: Enables users to update their personal information.
* Password Reset: Provides a way for users to reset their passwords if forgotten.
